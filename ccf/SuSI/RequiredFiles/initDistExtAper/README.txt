Ion distribution data files at extraction, serialized with cPickle. The 
particle distribution files were generated by SourceSuSI_v1.py tracking
ions from the bias disc to the extraction aperture. These files are used
as default distributions to test the WARP codes.

Run the script, 'plotData.py', in the python environment with execfile()
to visualize data stored in the 'SourceSuSI_v1_000_10.end' distribution
file.
