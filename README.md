# warp_ecr
Warp slice simulations of ECR ion sources and extraction beamlines at MSU using highly reduced models.

Code scripts assembled by Alfonse Pham based on highly reduced ECR ion source models by Damon Todd and Daniela Leitner (working at LBNL) which were extended by Daniel Winklehner (while a grad student at MSU).
